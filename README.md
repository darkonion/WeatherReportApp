# Simple Weather App

Simple commandLine app, that asks for country code and zip code, and then prints current weather report. <br>

App utilizes openweathermap.org api and downloads actual weather report in json format. Json is then converted into POJO manually
 (without Jackson/Gson) and printed on a console. App also introduces basic incorrect input protection based on regex.
